## Hi I'm Daniel🐼

I’m currently pursuing a degree in Software and Electronic Engineering with a focus on Design at the University of Los Andes in Bogotá, Colombia. Alongside my studies, I’m actively learning competitive programming to sharpen my problem-solving skills. As a student member of IEEE, I’m passionate about staying at the forefront of technology, exploring new developments, and contributing to innovative projects.

Feel free to explore my repositories to see what I’m working on and connect with me!
